1. What Is Mule ? (Mulesoft Interview Questions)

Answer:
Mule is a lightweight event-driven enterprise service bus (ESB) and an integration platform. It is a lightweight and modular solution that could scale from an application-level messaging framework to an enterprise-wide highly distributable object broker.

2. What is Shared Context ?

Answer:
Shared Context: Context is a temporary area which is created along with Service Message Object (SMO) in the Mediation Flows. Shared Context is a type of context which is present in the SMO. Shared Context is mainly used when we are using Aggregation process where we need to Iterate the BO for Certain times. Shared Context maintains Aggregation data between Aggregation (FanOut and FanIn) primitives. The Content (data) which is present in the shared context BO does not persist across Request and Response flows i.e The Data in the Shared Context which is used in Request flow can not be used again in Response flow.

3. What is the functionality of Fan-in and Fan-out ?

Answer:
Fan-out: We can use the Fan Out primitive to fire the output terminal once (with the input message) or to fire the output terminal multiple times. You can use Fan Out in isolation or as part of a Fan Out and Fan In combination.

Fan-In: Fan In is always partnered with a Fan Out in the same flow and acts as a decision point for when to continue flow execution. It receives a number of messages until a decision point is reached, at which point the last message to be received is propagated to the output terminal. The Fan In primitive may only be used in combination with Fan Out.

4. What is the Difference between SDO and SMO ?

Answer:
SDO: Service Data Object is the representation of the variable or Object.

SMO: The SMO model is a pattern for using SDO Data Objects to represent messages

5. Why The Name Mule ?

Answer:
There is a lot of infrastructure work to be done before we can really start thinking about implementing any logic. So this infrastructure work is regarded as “donkey work” as it needs doing for every project. A Mule is also commonly referred to as a carrier of load, moving it from one place to another. The load it specializes in moving is our enterprise information.

6. What are Batch Jobs in Mule ESB ?

Answer:
A batch job is a top-level element in Mule which exists outside all Mule flows. Batch jobs split large messages into records which Mule processes asynchronously in a batch job; just as flows process messages, batch jobs process records.
A batch job contains one or more batch steps which, in turn, contain any number of message processors that act upon records as they move through the batch job. During batch processing, you can use record-level variables (recordVars) and MEL expressions to enrich, route or otherwise act upon records.

7. What are the different types of Flow Processing Strategies ?

Answer:
There are six different types of Flow Processing Strategies. They are

1. Asynchronous Flow Processing Strategy.

8. What Are Available Esbs Apart From Mule?

Answer:
All major JEE vendors (BEA, IBM, Oracle, Sun) have an ESB in their catalog. It is unremarkably based on their middleware technologies and is usually at the core of a much broader SOA product suite. There are also some commercial ESBs that have been built by vendors not in the field of JEE application servers, like the ones from Progress Software, IONA Technologies, and Software AG.

Mulesoft Interview Questions

9. Why the Mulesoft is preferred than other ESB implementations ?

Answer:
Mule is lightweight but highly scalable, allowing you to start small and connect more applications over time. The ESB manages all the interactions between applications and components transparently, regardless of whether they exist in the same virtual machine or over the Internet, and regardless of the underlying transport protocol used.

Several commercial ESB implementation provide limited functionality or built on top of an existing application server or messaging server, locking you into that specific vendor. Mule is vendor-neutral, so different vendor implementations can plug in to it. You are never locked in to a specific vendor when you use Mule.

10. What Is Filter In Mule ?

Answer:
Filters are a powerful complement to the routers. Filters provide the brains routers need to make smart decisions about what to do with messages in transit. Some filters go as far as deeply analyzing the content of a message for a particular value on which their outcome will be based.

11. What are the different types of Web services ?

Answer:

Fail: Generates a failure in the flow.

13. How to add classes/jars to the Mule class path ?

Answer:
Use the MULE_LIB variable (generally set in the run script)
To include JAR file(s) in a mule class path, declare each dependent jar file in the MULE_LIB entry.
For spring resource, if the XML bean declaration is placed within a project, include the project JAR file in the class path too (i.e., if not included, Mule will throw a **.xml not found on class path)

14. What is Mule Data Integrator ?

Answer:
Mule has released a data integrator tool, it is a visual mapping tool which supports flat file, java object, XML mappings, etc. Coding complex mappings can be very tedious and additionally difficult to maintain, the mule data integrator with drag and drop facilities makes building and maintaining mappings very simple.

The mapping is done in eclipse (plugins required) and executed on a data integrator runtime which sits on top of Mule ESB – this requires a license.

15. Where to find the class Abstract Mule TestCase ?

A Mule UMO is a Universal Message Object

UMO is now a legacy term. What was once referred to as UMO Components are now referred to as Service Components.

20. Mule won’t start? Check your Environment ?

Answer:

The java and mule environment variables must be setup correctly for mule to start. If you are experiencing problems check the following variables:

MULE_HOME – should be the location of the mule install
JAVA_HOME – should be the location of the JDK
PATH – should have both JAVA_HOME\bin and MULE_HOME\bin in the path.
Check all of the above carefully. Some systems with multiple JDK’s installed can end up with incorrect mappings between the PATH and the JAVA_HOME, which will stop mule from loading.

21. Is MuleSoft open source ?

Answer:

MuleSoft is open source technology and it provides open source SOA middleware and related products.

A connector is in charge of controlling the usage of a particular protocol. It is configured with parameters that are specific to this protocol and holds any state that can be shared with the underlying entities in charge of the actual communications.

For example: a JMS connector is configured with a Connection, which is shared by the different entities in charge of the actual communication.

36. What Is Model Layer In Mule ?

Answer:

The first logical layer is the model layer. A Mule model represents the runtime environment that hosts services. It defines the behavior of Mule when processing requests handled by services. The model provides services with supporting features, such as exception strategies. It also provides services with default values that simplify their configuration.

37. What Is Service Layer In Mule ?

Answer:

A Mule service is composed of all the Mule entities involved in processing particular requests in predefined manners.A service is defined by a specific configuration. This configuration determines the different elements, from the different layers of responsibility, that will be mobilized to process the requests that it will be open to receive. Depending on the type of input channel it uses, a service may or may not be publicly accessible outside of the ESB.

43. What is the difference between SOAP and REST ?

Answer:

SOAP -> REST
1. SOAP is a protocol. -> REST is an architectural style.
2. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. -> REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
3. SOAP can’t use REST because it is a protocol. -> REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP.
4. SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic. -> REST uses URI to expose business logic.
5. SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed. -> REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.
6. SOAP defines standards to be strictly followed. -> REST does not define too much standards like SOAP.
7. SOAP requires more bandwidth and resource than REST. -> REST requires less bandwidth and resource than SOAP.
8. SOAP defines its own security. -> RESTful web services inherit security measures from the underlying transport.
9. SOAP permits XML data format only. -> REST permits different data format such as Plain text, HTML, XML, JSON etc.
10. SOAP is less preferred than REST. -> REST more preferred than SOAP.

44. What Is Component In Mule ?

Answer:

Components are the centerpiece of Mule’s services. Each service is organized with a component at its core and inbound and outbound routers around it. Components are used to implement a specific behavior in a service. This behavior can be as simple as logging messages or can go as far as invoking other services. Components can also have no behavior at all; in that case they are pass-through and make the service act as a bridge between its inbound and outbound routers.

45. What is SOAP Web Service ?

Answer:

SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is a XML-based protocol for accessing web services. SOAP is a W3C recommendation for communication between two applications.

SOAP is XML based protocol. It is platform independent and language independent. By using SOAP, you will be able to interact with other programming language applications.

46. What Is Transport Layer In Mule ?

Answer:

The transport layer is in charge of receiving or sending messages. This is why it is involved with both inbound and outbound communications. A transport manifests itself in the configuration by the following elements: connectors, endpoints and transformers.

A transport also defines one message adapter. A message adapter is responsible for extracting all the information available in a particular request (data, meta information, attachments, and so on) and storing them in transport-agnostic fashion in a Mule message.

swer :

A Mule message is composed of different parts: The payload, which is the main data content carried by the message.

The properties, which contain the meta information much like the header of a SOAP envelope or the properties of a JMS message. Optionally, multiple named attachments, to support the notion of multipart messages.

Optionally, an exception payload, which holds any error that occurred during the processing of the event.

47. How to find when the project needs ESB ?

Answer:

ESB implementation is not suitable for all projects. Proper analysis should be done if the use of ESB will really benefit the project.

Some of the points to be considered while analyzing the need of ESB are as follows:
>> If project requires integrating 3 or more applications/services. If the need is to communicate between two applications, using point-to-point integration would suffice.
>> If the project would need to be scaled in future where it might be needed to interact with more services in future. Not all projects need this as they may perform not that big a task.
>> If the project needs message routing capabilities such as forking and aggregating message flows. Such features are not required by all projects.
>> Is the architecture of what is to be achieved clear. Its much better to do simple POCs integrating small parts to evaluate the benefits.
>> Most ESBs are a costly affair. Does the project budget allow use of ESB.



Why Mule4 ?
Mule Message - the Mule Message structure has evolved to make it easier to work with properties and to provide more consistency across connectors.
Expression language - the Mule Expression Language has been replaced with the DataWeave language so that you work with data and learn Mule more easily.Connectors - the approach to connectivity was unified in Mule 4. Mule 3 transports were replaced with new operation-oriented connectors that are easier to use, have better out-of-the-box defaults, and provide new advanced capabilities.
Error Handling - easier and more powerful error handling with a new Try scope.
DataWeave - DataWeave includes minor changes to simplify the syntax and make it easier to learn.
Studio 7 - features a simplified palette, improved Maven integration, and many other usability improvements.
Runtime engine - the internal execution engine has been updated with a new self-tuning and non-blocking reactive engine. This allows for better performance and scalability out-of-the-box.

We need take care about 
endpoints, 
correct method creation for specific tasks  , 
correct response code, 
success category, 
exceptions handling, 
resources and field naming convention, 
filtering, 
versioning, pagination,
Naming conventionand verbs are most important one 


While design your API you need to follow some best practice:

First you to need understand why that type of API is best for your application, and then design it.

You need to consider who the API will be used by, to what actions do they need access, and then you must list out those actions. You need to explain how the API will interact with existing services, how the API will be maintained, how the API will be versioned, how it will be documented, how developers will interact with it, and how you are planning to manage support. There is a lot to consider in this stage, but careful thought now will save you time and effort later.

you create a blueprint or spec for your API.
